## IMPLEMENTATION OF ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION
## AIM:
## To implement encryption and decryption using C program.

## EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:

PC with Linux operating system

## ALGORITHM:
1] Open code blocks and type the program for encryption and decryption. 2] Save the program using extension .c
3]	Run the program using build and run.
4]	Prime number is given as input. If it is not a prime number then wrong input is displayed. 5] Then a message is entered.
6]	The encrypted form of the message is displayed.
7]	The decrypted form is also displayed as final output. 8] Thus the output is obtained.






SAMPLE OUTPUT:

RESULT:
Thus the encryption and decryption is implemented and the output is obtained and verified successfully
